# Algorithm

I have taken COMP 482 at CSU Northridge in Spring Semester 2020

I have been learning about Algorithm.

I am going to break the Algorithm down.

I have used the [specific textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Jon-Kleinberg-ebook/dp/B009TELNKO/ref=zg_bs_3870_50?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=7803D84Y6MPPJXPPTZVD), so I only learned each chapter from the book.

- Stable Matching

- Algorithm Analysis

- Graphs

- Greedy Algorithm

- Masters Theorem

  - (this part is not from the specific book. I am sure you can look it through Google. there are awesome resources outside about Masters Theorem)

- Divide and Conquer

- Dynamic Programming

- Network Flow

- NP and Computational Intractability

I assume some of you are familiar with Java which is the programming language.
